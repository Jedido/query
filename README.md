# Query!
This project was made as a creative project in CSE 154. It uses SQL and PHP to query an online* database to solve a puzzle.
*The database isn't actually online; it uses a database that must be initialized via setup.sql.

## Getting Started
Required: MAMP (Mac)/WAMP (Windows)
Use phpMyAdmin to run setup.sql. Drop the repository into the www/ folder of MAMP/WAMP, and navigate to it (via localhost).

## Credits
CSE 154 class - provided the code for common.php

## Disclaimers
The keys for the game are not protected in any way - it's a game, after all.
A lot of the code was written in accordance to the CSE 154 class guidelines, including the APIDOC.
